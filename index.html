        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
          Our mission is to create a reliable solar-powered charger that can track the sun and make renewable energy more accessible. 
          We want to design a system that performs well outdoors, stays efficient in changing conditions, and helps people charge their devices wherever they are.
          Through this project, we hope to show how thoughtful engineering can make clean energy practical and easy to use.
